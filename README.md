# Intellectual Property and Patent-Items 

This task of the Smart Methods summer training is all about how to register an intellectual property. Most - if not all- of the works and ideas done by Smart Methods are never done by any other, specially in Saudi Arabia, which makes them eligable for registering their ideas as a patent or intellectual property. 

So for registering an intellectual property, which any body can do that if they fulfill the conditions, should follow some steps. 

1 - Register at the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property at: https://www.saip.gov.sa/ 

They will give you four templates to fill, which are: 

- Abstract about the invention. 
- Full Description. 
- Protection items. 
- Graphics of the invention (if any).
